Poker hands of 5 cards can be ranked by certain combinations.  For sake of this exercise, your code must look at a poker “hand” of five cards and decide how high the hand is.  Hands can be as high as a straight flush.  For sake of this exercise, you only need to look for the following hands:

Straight flush:  This is the highest hand and occurs when all five cards can be arranged in contiguous order of rank and are of the same suit.  The highest straight flush goes from the rank of 10 to ace.  The lowest is ace to 5.

Four of a kind:  When all four cards of a particular suit are in a hand.

Flush:  When all the cards of a hand are of the same suit.

Three of a kind: When cards can be arranged so that three cards share the same rank.

One pair: If a hand can be arranged so that two cards share the same rank.

High card:  This is the lowest hand and should only apply when none of the above hands exist.  The highest card is the rank of Ace.

 

You must write a function that will somehow accept the five cards of a hand and will examine the cards.  It will then return some way to indicate the highest hand from above.

You are to write about how you would approach this problem.  What classes will you use?  How will the function indicate the hand?  What data structures would be useful here?  What problems do you see in your approach?  Feel free to include code, but this is more about designing a solution using your knowledge of data structures.
