Assignment: Linked List 1  

Due Date: Wednesday, September 23, 2015

For this assignment we will be adding to the Video Game example we did in class.

## Doubly Linked List

- Make the node able to be added to a Doubly Linked List.
- In other words, you will need to add a previous pointer to the node.
- In addition, add a tail pointer to the holder class.

## append, removeByTitle

- We made two methods thus far, append and remove by title.
- Ensure these two methods now assign the previous pointer and the tail pointer correctly.
- The append (add) method should now use the tail pointer as a quick way to append to the linked list.

## showAll
- Add at least three nodes and test the new functionality by calling the showAll method.
- Ensure you test the remove method as well in a similar way.
