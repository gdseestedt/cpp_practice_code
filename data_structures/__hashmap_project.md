# Hash map
**Friday, December 4, 2015**

- Use the Bank Accounts listed in the BST Understanding exercise.
- load them into a HashMap keyed by account number.
- Use the hash function in class.
- Use 11 buckets.
- At the end of the load,
    + go back through the buckets and
    + report how many collisions there were and how many empty buckets there are.
    + What do your results show about the hash function?
