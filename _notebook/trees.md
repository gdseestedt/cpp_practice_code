# Trees
- A tree starts with a root node
â€“ Convenient for storing data that is hierarchical
- useful for making decisions on problems


## Binary search tree
- left child  < parent
- right child > parent

- Advantages:
    - finding data can be better than sequential search
    - inserting a node

- Drawbacks:
    - Deleting a node (E.g. deleting root or parent node)
    - Must have a unique key
    - In the worst case, no better than a linked list
